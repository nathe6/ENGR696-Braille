# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
(Can be done in parallel)
  # 1. Mode Selection
  # 2. Previous Selection 
  # 3. Next Selection
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    1. Configure 24 GPIO pins to push/pull
    2a. Mode Selection: 
      - Configure 3 LEDs to indicate mode of braille, played with corresponding audio
      - Implement the switch case statements
      - Refresh all pin function (could reuse the pull-down and push-up physical functions)
    2b. Next Selection:
      - Refresh all pin function
      - Implement switch case statements (case++);
      - Pull up pins for the case
    2c. Previous Selection:
      - Refresh all pin function
      - Implement switch case statements (case++);
      - Pull up pins for the case
    3. Test and debug
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
